\`IN_topologies\`
=================

This folder contains input Excel worksheets for the simulation. These contain
all the necessary information about the network topology. We have provided two
examples for you to play around with.

 

For compatibility reasons, we have kept the input and output worksheets in
German. Here is a breakdown of the columns:

 

“Knoten” sheet

This sheet defines everything related to the nodes (feeders, consumers,
distributor nodes):
