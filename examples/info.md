`examples` Folder
=================

This is an exemplary data folder for use with the simulation. It consists of
several subfolders:

 

-   `examples/IN_raw_data` contains the raw historical data which is to be
    processed by the data preparation routine. The structure of this data
    depends on the network operator, so you might have to adjust the routines in
    the `data prep` folder to fit your data structure.

-   `examples/IN_topologies` contains the input Excel workbooks where the
    network topology is defined. By default, the simulation results are also
    stored in this folder.

-   `examples/IN_weather_data` contains weather data which is used for
    gapfilling.

-   `examples/OUT_load_profiles` contains standard load profiles used for
    gapfilling.

-   `examples/OUT_ml_models` contains trained ML models used for gapfilling.

-   `examples/OUT_prepared_data` contains the data generated by the data
    preparation routine. This data is used as an input for the network
    simulation.

-   `examples/OUT_visualisations` contains visualistations generated by the
    simulation.

 

The location of the data folder can be changed in `options.py`, line 22.
