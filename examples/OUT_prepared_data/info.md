This folder is an output of the data prep routine, but an input for the
simulation itself.

 

It contains the preprocessed historical consumer and feeder data, ready for the
simulation. We have provided some exemplary files with static synthetic data for
running the simulation. For running the simulation with your own data, please
adhere strictly to the formatting of the exemplary csvs.

 

Naming conventions
==================

-   Feeders must be named \`Router_WMZ_[ID]_prepared.csv\`
